    "Welcome back to the Kaggle 5-day Generative AI course. In this notebook, you'll learn some techniques for evaluating the output of a language model. As part of the evaluation, you will also use Gemini's structured data capability to produce evaluation results as instances of Python types.\n",

    "Note: This notebook is more code-heavy than the first Day 1 notebook ([Prompting](https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-1-prompting/)). This notebook is not a prerequisite for days 2 and beyond, so feel free to skip over it, or come back later in the week. If you have not yet tried the [Prompting](https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-1-prompting/) notebook, start there first as it introduces the fundamentals for interacting with LLMs.\n",

       "\n",
       "**Key Aspects of the Training Process:**\n",
       "\n",
       "1.  **Model Architecture:**\n",
       "    *   Gemini 1.5 Pro is a sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Transformer-based model.\n",
       "    *   It builds upon the research advances of Gemini 1.0 and a longer history of MoE research at Google.\n",
       "    *   MoE models use a learned routing function to direct inputs to a subset of the model's parameters for processing. This allows for a larger total parameter count while keeping the number of activated parameters constant.\n",
       "\n",
       "2.  **Training Infrastructure:**\n",
       "    *   Trained on multiple 4096-chip pods of Google's TPUv4 accelerators.\n",
       "    *   The training is distributed across multiple datacenters.\n",
       "\n",
       "3.  **Training Data:**\n",
       "    *   A variety of multimodal and multilingual data is used.\n",
       "    *   The pre-training dataset includes data sourced from various domains, including web documents, code, images, audio, and video content.\n",
       "\n",
       "4.  **Instruction Tuning:**\n",
       "    *   Gemini 1.5 Pro is fine-tuned on a collection of multimodal data containing paired instructions and appropriate responses.\n",
       "    *   Further tuning is based on human preference data.\n",
       "\n",
       "5.  **Long-Context Understanding:**\n",
       "    *   The model incorporates significant architecture changes to enable long-context understanding of inputs up to 10 million tokens without degrading performance.\n",
       "\n",
       "6.  **Safety Mitigations:**\n",
       "    *   Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning through human feedback (RLHF) are used to mitigate safety risks.\n",
       "    *   The safety mitigation is focused on adversarial or \"harm-inducing\" queries.\n",
       "    *   New image-to-text SFT data is incorporated, as safety SFT data for text-only queries was not as effective for harm-inducing image-to-text queries.\n",
       "\n",
       "**In summary:** The training process for Gemini 1.5 Pro involves a combination of a sophisticated MoE Transformer architecture, massive computational resources, diverse multimodal data, instruction tuning, and safety mitigations. The model is designed to handle extremely long contexts, enabling it to process and reason over large amounts of information from various modalities."

       "Imagine you have a puppy, and you want to teach it to understand and do tricks.\n",
       "\n",
       "1.  **Lots and Lots of Examples:** First, you show the puppy tons and tons of things. You show it pictures of cats, dogs, cars, and houses. You also read it lots of stories and tell it lots of things. This is like giving the computer model a huge pile of books, pictures, videos, and sounds.\n",
       "\n",
       "2.  **Learning the Rules:** The puppy starts to notice patterns. It sees that cats have pointy ears and dogs have floppy ears. It learns that when you say \"sit,\" it should put its bottom on the ground. The computer model does the same thing. It looks for patterns in all the information it has and learns the rules of language and the world.\n",
       "\n",
       "3.  **Practicing and Getting Feedback:** Now, you ask the puppy to do things. You say \"sit,\" and if it sits, you give it a treat and say \"Good dog!\" If it doesn't sit, you gently show it what to do. The computer model also practices. It tries to answer questions, write stories, and translate languages. If it does a good job, it gets a \"treat\" (a small adjustment to its rules). If it makes a mistake, it gets corrected.\n",
       "\n",
       "4.  **Getting Better and Better:** The puppy keeps practicing and getting feedback, and it gets better and better at understanding and doing tricks. The computer model does the same thing. It keeps learning from its mistakes and getting better at all the different tasks it can do.\n",
       "\n",
       "So, basically, training a large language model is like teaching a puppy, but instead of treats and belly rubs, you use math and computers to help it learn! The more examples you give it, and the more feedback it gets, the smarter it becomes.\n",

       "Based on the document provided, here's a breakdown of the metrics used to evaluate long context performance, along with additional context:\n",
       "\n",
       "**Key Metrics for Evaluating Long Context Performance**\n",
       "\n",
       "The document highlights the following metrics used to assess the long-context capabilities of Gemini 1.5 Pro:\n",
       "\n",
       "1.  **Near-Perfect Recall on Long-Context Retrieval Tasks:**\n",
       "    *   The document emphasizes Gemini 1.5 Pro's ability to achieve near-perfect recall on long-context retrieval tasks across modalities.\n",
       "    *   Specifically, it mentions achieving >99% recall on synthetic retrieval tasks up to at least 10M tokens.\n",
       "    *   This is measured using a \"needle-in-a-haystack\" task, where the model must reliably recall information amidst distractor context.\n",
       "    *   The document also mentions that Gemini 1.5 Pro maintains this recall performance when extending to 10M tokens in text modality, 9.7M tokens in audio modality, and 9.9M tokens in video modality.\n",
       "\n",
       "2.  **Perplexity over Long Sequences:**\n",
       "    *   The document uses perplexity, specifically negative log-likelihood (NLL), to evaluate the model's ability to make use of long contexts to improve next-token prediction.\n",
       "    *   NLL is recorded at different positions in the input sequences from held-out text.\n",
       "    *   A lower NLL value implies improved prediction.\n",
       "    *   The shape of the resulting curve (NLL as a function of token position) indicates the model's ability to reason over long contexts. A downward trend signifies models making use of long-context to reduce models' uncertainty.\n",
       "\n",
       "3.  **Win-Rate:**\n",
       "    *   The document uses win-rate to compare Gemini 1.5 Pro to Gemini 1.0 Pro and Gemini 1.0 Ultra on a broad set of benchmarks.\n",
       "    *   Win-rate is the percentage of benchmarks on which Gemini 1.5 Pro performs better than the other models.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Additional Context and Details**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Synthetic \"Needle-in-a-Haystack\" Tasks:** These tasks, inspired by Kamradt (2023), probe how reliably the model can recall information amidst distractor context. The model is given a long sequence of text, video, or audio (the \"haystack\") and a specific piece of information (the \"needle\") is inserted at a random location. The model is then asked to retrieve the \"needle.\" The success rate of retrieving the needle is the primary metric.\n",
       "*   **Real-World Multimodal Long-Context Benchmarks:** These benchmarks require retrieval and reasoning over multiple parts of the context, such as answering questions from long documents or long videos.\n",
       "*   **Qualitative Evaluations:** The document also mentions qualitative evaluations to probe and stress-test the model's long-context abilities, especially for novel capabilities where no quantitative benchmarks exist. An example is the model's ability to learn to translate a new language from a single set of linguistic documentation.\n",
       "*   **Long-Document QA:** The model's ability to answer questions about long documents (e.g., \"Les Misérables\") is evaluated. This requires understanding relationships between pieces of information spanning large portions of text.\n",
       "*   **Long-Context ASR:** The model's performance on automatic speech recognition (ASR) is evaluated on long audio segments.\n",
       "*   **Long-Context Video QA:** The model's ability to answer questions about long videos is evaluated. A new benchmark, 1H-VideoQA, is introduced for this purpose.\n",
       "*   **In-Context Language Learning:** The model's ability to learn to translate a new language from one book is evaluated using the Machine Translation from One Book (MTOB) benchmark.\n",
       "*   **Multi-round Co-reference Resolution (MRCR):** The model is presented with a long conversation between a user and a model, in which the user requests writing on different topics proceeded by the model responses. The model must reproduce the model's output resulting from one of the two requests.\n",
       "\n",
       "In summary, the document uses a combination of synthetic and real-world tasks, along with quantitative and qualitative metrics, to comprehensively evaluate the long-context capabilities of Gemini 1.5 Pro. The key metrics focus on recall, perplexity, and win-rate, while the tasks cover a range of modalities and scenarios.\n"

    "Now Python's sorting functions will \"just work\" on any `QAGuidancePrompt` instances. The `answer_question` and `eval_pairwise` functions are [memoized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization) to avoid unnecessarily regenerating the same answers or evaluations, so you should see this complete quickly unless you have changed the questions, prompts or number of iterations from the earlier steps."

    "\n",
    "### LLM limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs are known to have problems on certain tasks, and these challenges still persist when using LLMs as evaluators. For example, LLMs can struggle to count the number of characters in a word (this is a numerical problem, not a language problem), so an LLM evaluator will not be able to accurately evaluate this type of task. There are solutions available in some cases, such as connecting tools to handle problems unsuitable to a language model, but it's important that you understand possible limitations and include human evaluators to calibrate your evaluation system and determine a baseline.\n",
    "\n",
    "One reason that LLM evaluators work well is that all of the information they need is available in the input context, so the model only needs to attend to that information to produce the result. When customising evaluation prompts, or building your own systems, keep this in mind and ensure that you are not relying on \"internal knowledge\" from the model, or behaviour that might be better provided from a tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Improving confidence\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to improve the confidence of your evaluations is to include a diverse set of evaluators. That is, use the same prompts and outputs, but execute them on different models, like Gemini Flash and Pro, or even across different providers, like Gemini, Claude, ChatGPT and local models like Gemma or Qwen. This follows the same idea used earlier, where repeating trials to gather multiple \"opinions\" helps to [reduce error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers), except by using different models the \"opinions\" will be more diverse.\n",
